# chokidar-children [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcollina/chokidar-children.png)](https://travis-ci.org/chokidar-children/mqemitter)


Wrap [chokidar](http://npm.im/chokidar) in a children process, so that it is crash free.

This is an _ugly hack_ that works for me

It should mostly have the same API of
[chokidar](http://npm.im/chokidar).
